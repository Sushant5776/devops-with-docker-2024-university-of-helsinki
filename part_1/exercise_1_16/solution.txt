I have deployed course content image (devopsdockeruh/coursepage)

I do not have dockerfile as the 'render' platform for deployment has feature to deploy images directly from docker hub!

Steps:
1. Login to Render
2. Create a New Project
3. Select Docker Deployment
4. Provide Image URL
5. Hit Deploy
