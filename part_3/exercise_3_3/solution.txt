I have used the powershell script as I am running docker on windows and to use docker cli I need to pass commands as powershell commands.

- builder.ps1 is the script to run on windows machine.
- Change the line number 18 by replacing <docker hub username> with the actual docker hub username and <docker hub password> with actual docker hub password
- Run the script with powershell command ==> .\builder.ps1 -gitHubRepo mluukkai/express_app -dockerHubRepo garudkar/testing
